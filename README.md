This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.

go to the path where you cloned the application, run npm install to install all required modules, then Run `ng serve` and Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Comparison section

in this section there is a drag and drop functionality for comparing cars, you must drag from the lef side and drop on the right side, in order to remove a vehicle yo must do drag and drop from right side to left side.

###Note
left side list is scrollable, once it loades all cars comes up and you have the possibility to filter with the top select.

## Filter

In the specification of the requirement says to use a text field, but I noticed I already have access to the list of brands so I included a select for filter this avoids user to type brands that are no on the data.
